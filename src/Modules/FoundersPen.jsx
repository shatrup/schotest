                                        "It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men". A wise quote
                                        referring to the role that children could play in laying the foundation of a strong
                                        nation.
                                        I believe that the foundation of a strong nation depends on the way its children are
                                        cared for and nurtured. In order to build a strong nation, we must instill good values
                                        in our children providing them love and care, guiding them through thick and thin till
                                        they become confident and strong enough. This all can be done through “Quality
                                        education”.
                                        The “Quality Education” is an everlasting birthright of child.I urge you all to support
                                        quality education because without it we can't sustain or enjoy the independence that we
                                        have. Let’s start a revolution for quality education for every child of our country so
                                that we can help ourselves and children to build a better future and a proud nation.                            </p>
